Hi, I am Emmanuel Martínez and this is a website dedicated to post projects, research and other stuff. I graduated from the Universidad Autónoma Del Estado De Hidalgo (UAEH) with a Bachelor’s in Physics and Advanced Technology. I am a great enthusiast about science and technology, and also a video games and music lover.
